  version: 1.0.2

    ## ðŸ“‹ Overview

    Sigma Cloud Events Tracker is a background job that monitors Segware event activity in 2-hour intervals. It connects to the Segware API, retrieves recent events, and filters them based on predefined codes and CUCs. Events are aggregated by account, CUC, and code, and if their count exceeds a configurable threshold, alerts are generated.

    Each alert is enriched with external metadata from Segwareâ€™s account, company, and client group APIs. Alerts are tracked in internal databases and optionally sent via WhatsApp or injected into Segware's event system. Redundant alerts are avoided using a trigger tracking table, and alerts are automatically cleared once event volume normalizes.

    The system is fault-tolerant, retries intelligently on API limits, and logs all activity for audit and observability. This enables proactive detection of excessive or misconfigured event activity across monitored environments.

    ### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives 
    
    - Monitor Segware alarm events within a rolling 2-hour window
    - Fetch event data from the Segware API with bearer token authentication
    - Support batched time windows to handle API pagination and data limits
    - Filter events based on a predefined set of codes
    - Filter events by a provided set of CUCs
    - Aggregate event occurrences by CUC, account ID, and event code
    - Generate alerts when event counts exceed the defined threshold
    - Store and track active alerts to prevent duplicates
    - Automatically clear alerts when event volumes fall below threshold
    - Enrich alert data with account, company, and client group metadata
    - Send alert messages to WhatsApp using the ChatPro API
    - Inject alerts into Segwareâ€™s alarm event endpoint
    - Persist alert records and metadata in internal reporting tables
    - Log all operations and failures for observability and debugging
    - Run as a scheduled background job suitable for automation environments
